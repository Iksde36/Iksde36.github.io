            Tupolev Tu-154 for X-Plane

                "I did not create this plane on my own. It is a work of many talented people on whose
                tremendous work I could build to create the XP-12 version. The codebase for this model comes
                from Felis’ outstanding Tu-154M for X-plane 10 (If you ever thought about buying his 747, wait no
                more!). A few years ago, a Russian group of enthusiasts, called the ‘Masterskaya Team’, created
                a several mods of Felis’ original model, including a B-2 version with an all-new cockpit and 3D
                model. However, since the base code was still encrypted back then, they had to work around a
                lot of limitations, which compromised modelling accuracy in many areas.

            <div class="text-paragraph">
                In 2023, Felis made his original model open-source, which enabled anyone to edit the base code for any
                version of
                the Tu-154 which was based on Felis’ model. This included the B-2 mod and I started improving
                small things here and there that always bothered me. Over a few months, this ‘escalated’ into
                major rewrites of the base code and the flight model. This resulted in the flight model and
                systems update (FMSU) addon for the B-2 mod, which remedied most of the original B-2 mods
                shortcomings.
            </div>
            <div class="text-paragraph">
                However, by that time XP-11 became more and more obsolete, especially with
                XP-12 shaping up nicely. With no Tu-154 for XP-12 on the horizon (the Masterskaya team stopped
                working on their mods in 2023), I took it upon myself to port their B-2 to XP-12 using the
                experience I gathered from creating the FMSU. After months of coding, testing, fixing and
                tweaking, I can finally present a version that I am comfortable with. In the end, the XP-12 version
                turned out even better in terms of engine and flight model accuracy than the XP-11 version since
                XP-12 introduced some neat ways for plugins to interact with the flight modelling engine. With
                the help of former real-life aircrew and maintainers, I was also able to bring various aircraft
                systems closer to their real-life counterpart." :Silver
