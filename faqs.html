            Here you can see the most asked questions about Tu-154. For questions about how to fly it read the manual or
            head into <a class="sub-text-link" href="#">discord</a>.

            Where can I download any Tu-154 for X-Plane 11/12?
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text">
            Check the <a class="sub-text-link" href="#">HOME</a> page. There you need to scroll down and you will find
            everything about how to download it and install it.

            Is Tu-154M available for X-Plane 12?
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text">
            No. There is one in development by Corntingency, but it is expected to take more than two years.

            The KLN crashes
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text">
            The KLN used here is the original EADT KLN modded by Todir to work with XP-12. It is one giant old script
            and near impossible to debug for me since I have not made it. It is buggy and likes to crash/hang but it’s
            also the best we have. You can always reload it through the plugin admin and try to avoid whatever made it
            crash the last time. Reloading the KLN will not crash the plane anymore since the KLN is now a separate SASL
            module.

            BetterPushBack does not turn the airplane
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text">
            Make sure that the nosewheel steering power switch on the captain’s yoke is off during pushback. Otherwise,
            the pushback tug will not be able to turn the nose wheel.

            How to use the NVU?
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text">
            The NVU is the legacy doppler dead-reckoning navigation device on the pedestal. If you want to make your
            simming experience more challenging, then this device is for you. I’ve included the old PT manual
            in the docs folder which explains NVU navigation. It works the same way in this version. But be sure to have
            a GPS device close by…

            How to calculate navigation data for the NVU?
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text">
            There is a great tool by Vantskruv which calculates the headings and distances that you need for NVU
            navigation.
